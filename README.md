**Docbook2html5** is a simple-to-use utility for converting study materials in Docbook / Docbook Slides format into the SGML variant of HTML5. Currently available transformation stylesheets are a bit antiquated and this project attempts to fix it by fully leveraging HTML5 technologies and giving a fresh, modern feel to the output web page / presentation slides.

##Usage##
* Download and open docbook2html5.jar file. 
* Select the input files (Open file). 
* Choose transformation mode (Docbook or Docbook Slides)
* and hit the Tranform button (It may take a couple of minutes for the process to complete).

##Team##
This was a course project developed by these awesome people:

* Jakub Hamerník ()
* Michal Obročník (mbixby)
* Lubomír Šálek ()
* Petr Zvoníček ()

#For developers#

##Todo##
* encapsulate all slides in div; make it work for global l/r padding
* floating navBar div
* links with animations (stacking)

* consolidate output assets for docbook slides (images, css, js) into single companion file 
* bug: when transforming files with the Java tool, it sends some http (:80) requests
* slide-to-slide links
